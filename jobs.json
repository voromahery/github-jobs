    "description": "<p>About Buffer</p>\n<p>We're cultivating a unique and robust culture, and building a different type of company that’s focused not only on the bottom line, but also the happiness and personal growth of our customers and team along the journey.</p>\n<p>DevOps Engineer Role</p>\n<p>The Infrastructure team at Buffer is a small team of 4 entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring our product engineering teams can deliver a high-quality, reliable and secure service to our customers. This starts from the lowest level of deploying and maintaining our Kubernetes cluster(s) to building custom tooling for other engineers to automate workflows of development and deployment.</p>\n<p>At Buffer Engineering, we embrace self-service DevOps. This means, that the Infrastructure team is not an “Ops team,” but a team always aiming to provide the tooling, monitoring, safeguards and automation to let our product engineering teams deliver software quickly and confidently. This is an engineering team which empowers other engineering teams.</p>\n<p>As a team, we care about maintenance and security. We help ensure that dependencies, database versions and language environments are upgraded at a healthy and sustainable cadence. We believe any great product should be build on a solid foundation.</p>\n<p>Who You'll Work With</p>\n<p>In this role you’ll report to Colin, the Engineering Manager of the Infrastructure team. Day to day you’ll work closely with and be supported by your colleagues covering areas such as Site Reliability, Security &amp; Compliance as well as our Kubernetes platform. More widely, this role will involve considerable collaboration and consultation with product engineers and product engineering managers to identify opportunities and find pain points in our current workflows.</p>\n<p>What You'll Do</p>\n<p>The mission of the Infrastructure team is to enable product teams to be successful. Ultimately, you’ll make the lives of our product engineers easier. You’ll help us to deliver a high quality product into the hands of our valued customers multiple times a day by helping engineers automate the process of building and shipping code from local development environments to testing to continuous deployment pipelines.</p>\n<p>On a given day you might spend some time working with a product engineer to help prepare a new micro-service for deployment to our cluster, working through our production readiness checklist and ensuring the service is ready, while noting any ambiguities or inconsistencies in the process. Later you might continue adding some additional capabilities to our deployment pipeline to support some new workflows specific to python applications. You might finish the day by putting some final touches to a new tool you’ve been creating to help engineers identify services which are approaching scaling limits so we can perform any necessary work before it’s too late.</p>\n<p>We strive to have a healthy mix of smaller, reactive tasks mixed in with more proactive longer term projects. Communication and education are key aspects of this role, and you will likely spend time creating written documentation or recording screencasts about our tools as well as actively seeking feedback via interviews or surveys.</p>\n<p>Our Current Tech Stack</p>\n<p>Here are some of the tools we currently use, and that you’ll be expected to work with, debug, or otherwise support. We’re always open to using something new if it’s a better tool for the job!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Infrastructure: Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, Cloudflare</li>\n<li>Pipelines: Helm, Github Actions, Jenkins, Travis CI</li>\n<li>Scripting: Node.js, Python, Bash, Shell scripting, Infra-as-code (e.g. Terraform)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Helpful Skills and Experience</p>\n<p>More important than specific technical skills, we are looking for someone who is eager to solve problems and do the work to identify those problems and then work collaboratively and creatively to solve them. We have existing CI/CD pipelines and local developer environment tooling and are always looking for ways to remove pain points and be more efficient, allowing product engineers to craft software with the confidence that it will work when it is deployed to production.</p>\n<p>That said, we expect that the successful candidate will satisfy most of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An ability to work with underspecified and changing requirements and do the work necessary to uncover assumptions and find appropriate solutions.</li>\n<li>The confidence to work independently and to find a way forward when obstacles appear.</li>\n<li>A deep interest in delivering intuitive and reliable well-documented tools.</li>\n<li>Track record supporting and enabling engineering teams with developer tools (cli tools, designing and maintaining CI/CD pipelines, scripting and automation).</li>\n<li>Proficiency in debugging/troubleshooting complex systems and a strong growth mindset to learn and figure out unknowns.</li>\n<li>A track record in exercising good judgement around build-or-buy decisions for developer tooling (i.e. when to build a custom solution vs buying one off-the-shelf) is helpful, but not required.</li>\n<li>While we prioritize skill and interest over number of years of experience, successful applicants typically have least 3 years experience as an engineer working with cloud services &amp; platforms. Experience working on SaaS solutions a bonus.</li>\n</ul>\n",

This goes beyond just the languages we use, to the industries and problem domains we work in. We look for generalists; most importantly those who are excited to learn and take on new challenges. You can expect to grow both in your strength and your versatility when working here. We want to help you do so.</p>\n<p>We work remotely all over the United States and Canada. We expect you to be able to work well on your own and comfortably with teams. You won’t have someone looking over your shoulder so you'll need to be communicative and reliable, and hold yourself accountable. We depend on each other.</p>\n<p>Art+Logic is run by humans, who work and create using technology. Things can go wrong and we need to respond to the unexpected by being kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. We treat our clients and peers as respectfully as we would like to be treated.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example of some projects we’ve worked on recently, so you can better understand the wide range of projects and challenges we undertake:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implementing a Django-based DoD CAC card login</li>\n<li>Writing a data model layer using SQLAlchemy to provide an object-oriented view of a legacy relational database schema. This model layer provides all business rules and data integrity using advanced python3 features. This data model in turn serves a REST API (python-pyramid) consumed by an advanced single-page web application written with Marionette (Backbone)</li>\n<li>Created Windows tablet application to communicate with client's modbus hardware and upload data to Python/Django/Vue webapp for analysis and display</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What we want from you: (aka: skills)</strong></p>\n<p>We currently have a high demand for Python, specifically Django, and JavaScript web framework experience.</p>\n<p>However, more important than that, we are looking for people who are curious and looking for opportunities to learn. People who like learning and creating on their own. Those who are able to drive themselves or even lead others when completing projects. Developers who are able to organize and express their ideas. Communication is paramount here.</p>\n<p><strong>Relationship Details:</strong></p>\n<p>We are looking for Contractors (1099) for long term open-ended relationships. Work hours are flexible; requiring reasonable overlap with normal working hours to support team communications, and not just nights and weekends. Our rates range from $35-$55/hour. We are ONLY looking for people in the United States and Canada.</p>\n<p>We want you to enjoy working for us, and to be able to have a life outside of work. Since you're not commuting you can embrace the freedom of working from where you enjoy living, and use the saved time for your personal life and relationships. We don’t ask our developers to work consistently over 40 hours/week.</p>\n<p>It’s important to us in the hiring process that we allow developers to demonstrate their abilities by actually developing something, because a list of previous employers or educational background aren’t always indicators of what someone can do. All applicants are asked to submit a solution to a programming challenge that emulates a task we might assign on a project.</p>\n<p><strong>About Art &amp; Logic, Inc.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://artandlogic.com/blog\">http://artandlogic.com/blog</a> (it's a tech blog, not a \"company\" blog)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/artandlogic\">www.facebook.com/artandlogic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://artandlogic.com/careers\">https://artandlogic.com/careers</a></li>\n<li>Visit our Twitter @artandlogic</li>\n</ul>\n",

Less-flammable apps; fewer smouldering embers; automated fire suppression.</p>\n<p>Here are some real examples of the work we’ve done lately that might help you to get a better idea of what this job entails:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adoption of Shopify’s new versioned API - this one keeps us in business!</li>\n<li>Support for Shopify’s new bulk APIs; this cut our operating costs (fewer servers) and increased the speed of our backups.</li>\n<li>Rewind Copy for QuickBooks; #1 feature request for QuickBooks customers, move your data from here to there and make it easy.</li>\n<li>Rewind API (version 1); services that want to power data resiliency in their apps with Rewind can now do so.</li>\n<li>Hooking Hubspot into various areas of our product to capture customer events for sales/marketing.</li>\n<li>Addressing multiple code and database scaling challenges in the processing of daily backups for our American BigCommerce customers.</li>\n<li>Adding support for new entry level pricing plans that required creating limitations in product functionality.</li>\n<li>Implementing a new first time user experience features to <a href=\"https://app.rewind.io\">https://app.rewind.io</a>.</li>\n<li>Upgrading all applicable components from Rails 5 to Rails 6.</li>\n<li>Enhancements to our administrative interface (the one that support, sales, and marketing rely on) to bundle customers, change billing plans, and cancel subscriptions.</li>\n<li>Aggregating Webhooks with DynamoDB and SQS Delay Queues</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ABOUT YOU</p>\n<p>You are a perfect match for this role if you’re someone who possesses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Great troubleshooting and analytical skills, you’re an exceptional communicator, you have prior experience building or maintaining Ruby on Rails-based applications, and you have a curious mind for how things work and what makes them tick.</li>\n<li>You should enjoy making complicated situations simple and painless. You should be a stellar communicator, even when you have to communicate less-than-stellar news. You should have highly tuned senses of compassion and empathy and a drive to constantly help others.</li>\n<li>You must be proficient in REST and GraphQL APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Linux, and major browser development tools. You should be well-versed in AWS, source control management (preferably Git), Docker, and one of either Ruby or Python.</li>\n<li>You might have a CS degree. You might not. That’s not what we’re looking for. We care about what you can do and how you do it, not about how you got here.
